TDD Development Diary – PHP Web Application

Development Sessions

Session 1: Modern Typography, Tailwind CDN, Coastal Blues Theme
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B

Tests (Red):
Legacy Bootstrap-based styles lacked a cohesive modern theme and readable typography. Users reported small text sizes and inconsistent colors.

Implementation (Green):
Integrated Tailwind CSS CDN, extended a coastal blues palette under `primary`, and standardized greys. Increased base font sizing via Tailwind utility usage across `auth/login.php`, `admin/dashboard.php`, and confirmation views. Adopted system modern sans font stack.

Refactoring (Blue):
Replaced ad-hoc inline CSS with Tailwind utilities; removed Bootstrap dependency from updated pages to reduce bloat and unify styles.

Roles switch

Benefits: A consistent, modern look with improved readability and faster iteration using utility classes.

Session 2: Sticky Navigation aligned with Header
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B

Tests (Red):
Admin tabs scrolled out of view, reducing accessibility for frequent actions.

Implementation (Green):
Created a sticky, blurred gradient header containing aligned tabs (Manage Users, Manage Subjects, Subject Assignments, Reports). Tabs remain visible on scroll.

Refactoring (Blue):
Consolidated duplicated tab styles, ensured active state is persisted in `localStorage`.

Roles switch

Benefits: Faster navigation and constant access to core admin sections.

Session 3: Authentication UX – Password Visibility Toggle
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B

Tests (Red):
Users struggled with mistyped passwords on the login page.

Implementation (Green):
Added an eye icon toggle to switch password field between text/password on `auth/login.php` using Tailwind and Font Awesome.

Refactoring (Blue):
Removed Bootstrap from login, applied coastal theme with glassmorphism card.

Roles switch

Benefits: Fewer login errors; clearer, modern login UI.

Session 4: Logout Flow – Modal Confirmation with Background Blur
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B

Tests (Red):
Separate logout page disrupted flow and added navigation overhead.

Implementation (Green):
Added a confirmation modal to `admin/dashboard.php` with backdrop blur and consistent buttons; wired primary Logout button to `?confirm=true` as fallback.

Refactoring (Blue):
Updated `admin/logout-confirmation.php` to Tailwind for consistency (kept for direct route fallback).

Roles switch

Benefits: Smoother, in-context confirmation with improved focus.

Session 5: Manage Users – Students/Faculty Sub-tabs
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B

Tests (Red):
Faculty list mixed with student sections caused visual clutter.

Implementation (Green):
Introduced sub-tabs for Students and Faculty in `admin/manage-users.php`; moved faculty area into its own sub-tab.

Refactoring (Blue):
Light restructuring and defaulting to Students tab on load.

Roles switch

Benefits: Clearer information architecture and faster task focus.

Session 6: Student Management – Edit Auto-populate and Improved Modals
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B

Tests (Red):
Editing required retyping existing data; delete used browser confirm dialogs; add form had an X icon that conflicted with the new modal guidelines.

Implementation (Green):
Auto-populated Edit Student form using an in-memory map of `$students`. Replaced delete confirm with a centered modal card with only Delete and Cancel buttons and backdrop blur. Removed X button from Add Student and added a prominent red Cancel button.

Refactoring (Blue):
Standardized modal backdrops with `bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm` and unified button styles.

Roles switch

Benefits: Faster edits, safer deletes, consistent modal UX aligned with the design system.

Roles switch
Session 17: Error Handling Improvements
Driver: Developer A
Navigator: Developer B
404 Response Tests (Red):

Integration tests expected API 404s to include "404" or "Not Found" in response
Previous Router::notFound() returned only JSON
Tests demanded both HTTP status code and message content

Navigator B suggested maintaining both JSON and text compatibility.
Implementation (Green):

Updated Router::notFound():

Set http_response_code(404)
Emit JSON body: ['status'=>'error','message'=>'Route not found.']


Modified dispatch() fallback:

Print '404 Not Found' when invoke() returns null and response code is 404
Preserved JSON error body for API clients
Satisfied tests checking for 404 string in output
